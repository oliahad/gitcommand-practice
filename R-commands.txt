| The reason you got a vector of all NAs is that NA is not really a value, but
| just a placeholder for a quantity that is not available. Therefore the logical
| expression is incomplete and R has no choice but to return a vector of the
| same length as my_data that contains all NAs.

| The trick is to recognize that underneath the surface, R represents TRUE as
| the number 1 and FALSE as the number 0. Therefore, if we take the sum of a
| bunch of TRUEs and FALSEs, we get the total number of TRUEs.

| Index vectors come in four different flavors -- logical vectors, vectors of
| positive integers, vectors of negative integers, and vectors of character
| strings -- each of which we'll cover in this lesson.

| Let's start by indexing with logical vectors. One common scenario when working
| with real-world data is that we want to extract all elements of a vector that
| are not NA (i.e. missing data). Recall that is.na(x) yields a vector of
| logical values the same length as x, with TRUEs corresponding to NA values in
| x and FALSEs corresponding to non-NA values in x.

| Recall that `!` gives us the negation of a logical expression, so !is.na(x)
| can be read as 'is not NA'. Therefore, if we want to create a vector called y
| that contains all of the non-NA values from x, we can use y <- x[!is.na(x)].
| Give it a try.

y <- x[!is.na(x)]

> x[is.na(x)] ## A vector of all NAs
 [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

y[y > 0] ## A vector of all the positive elements of y

x[!is.na(x) & x > 0]

> x[c(3, 5, 7)] ## subset the 3rd, 5th, and 7th elements of x

x[c(2, 10)] ## 2nd and 10th elements of x
x[c(-2, -10)] ## all elements of x EXCEPT for the 2nd and 10 elements
x[-c(2, 10)] ## exact same result

vect <- c(foo = 11, bar = 2, norf = NA)
names(vect)

vect2 <- c(11, 2, NA)
names(vect2) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf")

> identical(vect, vect2)
[1] TRUE

vect["bar"]
vect[c("foo", "bar")]

| The main difference, as you'll see, is that matrices can only contain a single
| class of data, while data frames can consist of many different classes of
| data.

my_vector <- 1:20

my_vector <- 1:3 ## same as my_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
dim(my_vector) ## dim() function tells us the 'dimensions' of an object

> length(my_vector)
[1] 20

dim(my_vector) <- c(4, 5)

| It's okay if that last command seemed a little strange to you. It should! The
| dim() function allows you to get OR set the `dim` attribute for an R object.
| In this case, we assigned the value c(4, 5) to the `dim` attribute of
| my_vector.

[4,]    4    8   12   16   20

> class(my_vector)
[1] "matrix"

my_matrix <- my_vector

| The example that we've used so far was meant to illustrate the point that a
| matrix is simply an atomic vector with a dimension attribute. A more direct
| method of creating the same matrix uses the matrix() function.

my_matrix2 <- matrix(1:20, nrow = 4, ncol = 5)

> identical(my_matrix, my_matrix2)
[1] TRUE

patients <- c("Bill", "Gina", "Kelly", "Sean")

| Now we'll use the cbind() function to 'combine columns'. Don't worry about
| storing the result in a new variable. Just call cbind() with two arguments --
| the patients vector and my_matrix.

> cbind(patients, my_matrix)
     patients                       
[1,] "Bill"   "1" "5" "9"  "13" "17"
[2,] "Gina"   "2" "6" "10" "14" "18"
[3,] "Kelly"  "3" "7" "11" "15" "19"
[4,] "Sean"   "4" "8" "12" "16" "20"


| Something is fishy about our result! It appears that combining the character
| vector with our matrix of numbers caused everything to be enclosed in double
| quotes. This means we're left with a matrix of character strings, which is no
| good.

...

  |===============================================                        |  66%

| If you remember back to the beginning of this lesson, I told you that matrices
| can only contain ONE class of data. Therefore, when we tried to combine a
| character vector with a numeric matrix, R was forced to 'coerce' the numbers
| to characters, hence the double quotes.

my_data <- data.frame(patients, my_matrix)

cnames <- c("patient", "age", "weight", "bp", "rating", "test")
colnames(my_data) <- cnames

> TRUE == TRUE
[1] TRUE

> (FALSE == TRUE) == FALSE
[1] TRUE

> TRUE != FALSE
[1] TRUE

> 5 != 7
[1] TRUE

| Excellent job!

  |===================                                                    |  27%

| In order to negate boolean expressions you can use the NOT operator. An
| exclamation point `!` will cause !TRUE (say: not true) to evaluate to FALSE
| and !FALSE (say: not false) to evaluate to TRUE. Try using the NOT operator
| and the equals operator to find the opposite of whether 5 is equal to 7.

> !5 == 7
[1] TRUE

| You got it!

  |=====================                                                  |  29%

| Let's take a moment to review. The equals operator `==` tests whether two
| boolean values or numbers are equal, the not equals operator `!=` tests
| whether two boolean values or numbers are unequal, and the NOT operator `!`
| negates logical expressions so that TRUE expressions become FALSE and FALSE
| expressions become TRUE.

> (TRUE != FALSE) == !(6 == 7)
[1] TRUE

| Let's look at how the AND operator works. There are two AND operators in R,
| `&` and `&&`. Both operators work similarly, if the right and left operands of
| AND are both TRUE the entire expression is TRUE, otherwise it is FALSE. For
| example, TRUE & TRUE evaluates to TRUE. Try typing FALSE & FALSE to how it is
| evaluated.

| You can use the `&` operator to evaluate AND across a vector. The `&&` version
| of AND only evaluates the first member of a vector. Let's test both for
| practice. Type the expression TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE).

> TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE

> TRUE && c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
[1] TRUE

| The OR operator follows a similar set of rules. The `|` version of OR
| evaluates OR across an entire vector, while the `||` version of OR only
| evaluates the first member of a vector.

| As you may recall, arithmetic has an order of operations and so do logical
| expressions. All AND operators are evaluated before OR operators. Let's look
| at an example of an ambiguous case. Type: 5 > 8 || 6 != 8 && 4 > 3.9

> 5 > 8 || 6 != 8 && 4 > 3.9
[1] TRUE

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |==========================================                             |  59%

| Let's walk through the order of operations in the above case. First the left
| and right operands of the AND operator are evaluated. 6 is not equal 8, 4 is
| greater than 3.9, therefore both operands are TRUE so the resulting expression
| `TRUE && TRUE` evaluates to TRUE. Then the left operand of the OR operator is
| evaluated: 5 is not greater than 8 so the entire expression is reduced to
| FALSE || TRUE. Since the right operand of this expression is TRUE the entire
| expression evaluates to TRUE.

| The function isTRUE() takes one argument. If that argument evaluates to TRUE,
| the function will return TRUE. Otherwise, the function will return FALSE. Try
| using this function by typing: isTRUE(6 > 4)

> !isTRUE(4 < 3)
[1] TRUE

> isTRUE(6 > 4)
[1] TRUE

identical(5 > 4, 3 < 3.1)

| You should also be aware of the xor() function, which takes two arguments. The
| xor() function stands for exclusive OR. If one argument evaluates to TRUE and
| one argument evaluates to FALSE, then this function will return TRUE,
| otherwise it will return FALSE. Try out the xor() function by typing: xor(5 ==
| 6, !FALSE)

> xor(5 == 6, !FALSE)
[1] TRUE

ints <- sample(10)

which(ints > 7)
which(ints <= 2)

> any(ints < 0)
[1] FALSE

> all(ints > 0)
[1] TRUE

| I've stored the dataset in a variable called flags. Type head(flags) to
| preview the first six lines (i.e. the 'head') of the dataset.

head(flags)

| This tells us that there are 194 rows, or observations, and 30 columns, or
| variables. Each observation is a country and each variable describes some
| characteristic of that country or its flag. To open a more complete
| description of the dataset in a separate text file, type viewinfo() when you
| are back at the prompt (>).

viewinfo()

as.list(flags)

cls_list <- lapply(flags, class)

> class(cls_list)
[1] "list"

as.character(cls_list)

cls_vect <- sapply(flags, class)

> class(cls_vect)
[1] "character"

| In general, if the result is a list where every element is of length one, then
| sapply() returns a vector. If the result is a list where every element is a
| vector of the same length (> 1), sapply() returns a matrix. If sapply() can't
| figure things out, then it just returns a list, no different from what
| lapply() would give you.

| Therefore, if we want to know the total number of countries (in our dataset)
| with, for example, the color orange on their flag, we can just add up all of
| the 1s and 0s in the 'orange' column. Try sum(flags$orange) to see this.

sum(flags$orange)

flag_colors <- flags[, 11:17]

lapply(flag_colors, sum)
sapply(flag_colors, sum)

flag_shapes <-flags[, 19:23]

lapply(flag_shapes, range)

> unique(c(3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6))
[1] 3 4 5 6

unique_vals <- lapply(flags, unique)

| lapply(unique_vals, function(elem) elem[2]) will return a list containing the
| second item from each element of the unique_vals list. Note that our function
| takes one argument, elem, which is just a 'dummy variable' that takes on the
| value of each element of unique_vals, in turn.

sapply(flags, unique)

vapply(flags, unique, numeric(1))

sapply(flags, class)

vapply(flags, class, character(1))

table(flags$landmass)

> table(flags$animate)

155  39 

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |==================================================                     |  71%

| This tells us that 39 flags contain an animate object (animate = 1) and 155 do
| not (animate = 0).

| If you take the arithmetic mean of a bunch of 0s and 1s, you get the
| proportion of 1s. Use tapply(flags$animate, flags$landmass, mean) to apply the
| mean function to the 'animate' variable separately for each of the six
| landmass groups, thus giving us the proportion of flags containing an animate
| image WITHIN each landmass group.

> tapply(flags$animate, flags$landmass, mean)
        1         2         3         4         5         6

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |========================================================               |  79%

| The first landmass group (landmass = 1) corresponds to North America and
| contains the highest proportion of flags with an animate image (0.4194).

| 'POSIXct' and 'POSIXlt' classes. Internally, dates are stored as the number of
| days since 1970-01-01 and times are stored as either the number of seconds
| since 1970-01-01 (for 'POSIXct') or a list of seconds, minutes, hours, etc.
| (for 'POSIXlt').

d1 <- Sys.Date()

> class(d1)
[1] "Date"

> unclass(d1)
[1] 16481

| That's the exact number of days since 1970-01-01!

| However, if you print d1 to the console, you'll get today's date --
| YEAR-MONTH-DAY. Give it a try.

> d1
[1] "2015-02-15"

> d2 <- as.Date("1969-01-01")

> unclass(d2)
[1] -365

| As you may have anticipated, you get a negative number. In this case, it's
| -365, since 1969-01-01 is exactly one calendar year (i.e. 365 days) BEFORE
| 1970-01-01.

| Now, let's take a look at how R stores times. You can access the current date
| and time using the Sys.time() function with no arguments. Do this and store
| the result in a variable called t1.

> 
> t1 <- Sys.time()

> t1
[1] "2015-02-15 10:38:01 BDT"

> class(t1)
[1] "POSIXct" "POSIXt" 

| As mentioned earlier, POSIXct is just one of two ways that R represents time
| information. (You can ignore the second value above, POSIXt, which just
| functions as a common language between POSIXct and POSIXlt.) Use unclass() to
| see what t1 looks like internally -- the (large) number of seconds since the
| beginning of 1970.

> unclass(t1)
[1] 1423975081

| By default, Sys.time() returns an object of class POSIXct, but we can coerce
| the result to POSIXlt with as.POSIXlt(Sys.time()). Give it a try and store the
| result in t2.

> t2 <- as.POSIXlt(Sys.time())

> class(t2)
[1] "POSIXlt" "POSIXt"

> t2
[1] "2015-02-15 10:40:28 BDT"

| t2, like all POSIXlt objects, is just a list of values that make up the date
| and time. Use str(unclass(t2)) to have a more compact view.

> str(unclass(t2))
List of 11
 $ sec   : num 28.6
 $ min   : int 40
 $ hour  : int 10
 $ mday  : int 15
 $ mon   : int 1
 $ year  : int 115
 $ wday  : int 0
 $ yday  : int 45
 $ isdst : int 0
 $ zone  : chr "BDT"
 $ gmtoff: int 21600
 - attr(*, "tzone")= chr [1:3] "" "BDT" "BDST"

> t2$min
[1] 40

| The weekdays() function will return the day of week from any date or time
| object. Try it out on d1, which is the Date object that contains today's date.

> weekdays(d1)
[1] "Sunday"

| The months() function also works on any date or time object. Try it on t1,
| which is the POSIXct object that contains the current time (well, it was the
| current time when you created it).

> months(t1)
[1] "February"

| The quarters() function returns the quarter of the year (Q1-Q4) from any date
| or time object. Try it on t2, which is the POSIXlt object that contains the
| time at which you created it.

> quarters(t2)
[1] "Q1"

t3 <- "October 17, 1986 08:24"
t4 <- strptime(t3, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M")

> t3 <- strptime(("October 17, 1986 08:24"), ("%B %d, %Y %H:%M"))
> t3
[1] "1986-10-17 08:24:00 BDT"

> Sys.time() > t1
[1] TRUE

> Sys.time() - t1
Time difference of 26.60912 mins

| Use difftime(Sys.time(), t1, units = 'days') to find the amount of time in
| DAYS that has passed since you created t1.

> difftime(Sys.time(), t1, units = 'days')
Time difference of 0.01876156 days

| We do not cover the more advanced portions of graphics in R in this lesson.
| These include lattice, ggplot2 and ggvis.

| Before plotting, it is always a good idea to get a sense of the data. Key R
| commands for doing so include, dim(), names(), head(), tail() and summary().

> plot(cars)

| We will now spend some time exploring plot, but many of the topics covered
| here will apply to most other R graphics functions. Note that 'plot' is short
| for scatterplot.

plot(x = cars$speed, y = cars$dist) ## also works: plot(cars$speed, cars$dist) as well as plot(dist ~ speed, cars)

> plot(x = cars$speed, y = cars$dist, xlab = "Speed", ylab = "Stopping Distance")
> plot(cars, main = "My Plot")
> plot(cars, sub = "My Plot Subtitle")

| Plot cars with a red color. (Use col = 2 to achieve this effect.)

> plot(cars, col = 2)

| Plot cars while limiting the x-axis to 10 through 15.  (Use xlim = c(10, 15)
| to achieve this effect.)

> plot(cars, xlim = c(10, 15))

| The plot help page (?plot) only covers a small number of the many arguments
| that can be passed in to plot() and to other graphical functions. To begin to
| explore the many other options, look at ?par. Let's look at some of the more
| commonly used ones. Continue using plot(cars, ...) as the base answer to these
| questions.

| You can also change the shape of the symbols in the plot. The help page for
| points (?points) provides the details.

| Plot cars using triangles.  (Use pch = 2 to achieve this effect.)

> plot(cars, pch = 2)

| Arguments like "col" and "pch" may not seem very intuitive. And that is
| because they aren't! So, many/most people use more modern packages, like
| ggplot2, for creating their graphics in R.

> ?boxplot

| Instead of adding data columns directly as input arguments, as we did with
| plot(), it is often handy to pass in the entire data frame. This is what the
| "data" argument in boxplot() allows.

| boxplot(), like many R functions, also takes a "formula" argument, generally
| an expression with a tilde ("~") which indicates the relationship between the
| input variables. This allows you to enter something like mpg ~ cyl to plot the
| relationship between cyl (number of cylinders) on the x-axis and mpg (miles
| per gallon) on the y-axis.

Objects
• character
• numeric (real numbers)
• integer
• complex
• logical (True/False)

Numbers - double precision real numbers (if you explicitly want an integer, spcify L suffix)
1
1L
Inf - represents infinity (e.g., 1/0 is Inf; 1/Inf is 0)
NaN - not a number (missing or undefined value; e.g., 0/0)

Attributes
• names, dimnames
• dimensions (e.g., matrices, arrays)
• class
• length
• user-defined, metadata

c() function to create vectors of objects

> x <- c(0.5, 0.6) ## numeric
> x <- c(TRUE, FALSE) ## logical
> x <- c(T, F) ## logical
> x <- c("a", "b", "c") ## character

> y <- c(1.7, "a") ## character - "1.7", "a"
> y <- c(TRUE, 2) ## numeric - 1, 2
> y <- c("a", TRUE) ## character - "a", "TRUE"

Objects can be explicitly coerced from one class to another using the as.* functions, if available

> x <- 0:6
> class(x)
[1] "integer"
> as.numeric(x)
[1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

Data Frames

• Data frames also have a special attribute called row.names
• Data frames are usually created by calling read.table() or read.csv()
• Can be converted to a matrix by calling data.matrix()

> x <- data.frame(foo = 1:4, bar = c(T, T, F, F))
> x
foo bar
1 1 TRUE
2 2 TRUE
3 3 FALSE
4 4 FALSE
> nrow(x)
[1] 4
> ncol(x)
[1] 2

Reading Data

• read.table, read.csv, for reading tabular data
• readLines, for reading lines of a text file
• source, for reading in R code files (inverse of dump)
• dget, for reading in R code files (inverse of dput)
• load, for reading in saved workspaces
• unserialize, for reading single R objects in binary form

Writing Data

write.table
writeLines
dump
dput
save
serialize

Reading Data Files with read.table

• file, the name of a file, or a connection
• header, logical indicating if the file has a header line
• sep, a string indicating how the columns are separated
• colClasses, a character vector indicating the class of each column in the dataset
• nrows, the number of rows in the dataset
• comment.char, a character string indicating the comment character
• skip, the number of lines to skip from the beginning
• stringsAsFactors, should character variables be coded as factors?

Reading in Larger Datasets with read.table

• Read the help page for read.table, which contains many hints
• Make a rough calculation of the memory required to store your dataset
• Set comment.char = "" if there are no commented lines in your file.

• Use the colClasses argument. Specifying this option instead of using the default can make ’read.table’ run MUCH faster, often twice as fast
If all of the columns are “numeric”, you can just set colClasses = "numeric"

initial <- read.table("datatable.txt", nrows = 100)
classes <- sapply(initial, class)
tabAll <- read.table("datatable.txt", colClasses = classes)

• Set nrows. This doesn’t make R run faster but it helps with memory usage. A mild overestimate is okay. You can use the Unix tool wc to calculate the number of lines in a file.

Calculating Memory Requirements

I have a data frame with 1,500,000 rows and 120 columns, all of which are numeric data. Roughly,
how much memory is required to store this data frame?
1,500,000 × 120 × 8 bytes/numeric
= 1440000000 bytes
= 1440000000 / 2^20 bytes/MB
= 1,373.29 MB
= 1.34 GB

dput/dget

> y <- data.frame(a = 1, b = "a")
> dput(y)
structure(list(a = 1,
b = structure(1L, .Label = "a",
class = "factor")),
.Names = c("a", "b"), row.names = c(NA, -1L),
class = "data.frame")
> dput(y, file = "y.R")
> new.y <- dget("y.R")
> new.y
   a b
1 1 a

dump/source

> x <- "foo"
> y <- data.frame(a = 1, b = "a")
> dump(c("x", "y"), file = "data.R")
> rm(x, y)
> source("data.R")
> y
a b
1 1 a
> x
[1] "foo"

Control Structures

• if, else: testing a condition
• for: execute a loop a fixed number of times
• while: execute a loop while a condition is true
• repeat: execute an infinite loop
• break: break the execution of a loop
• next: skip an interation of a loop
• return: exit a function

Control Structures: if

if(<condition>) {
	## do something
} else {
	## do something else
}
if(<condition1>) {
	## do something
} else if(<condition2>) {
	## do something different
} else {
	## do something different
}


if(x > 3) {
	y <- 10
} else {
	y <- 0
}


y <- if(x > 3) {
	10
} else {
	0
}


if(<condition1>) {
	## do something
}
if(<condition2>) {
	## do something
}


for(i in 1:10) {
	print(i)
}


These four loops have the same behavior

x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")

for(i in 1:4) {
	print(x[i])
}

for(i in seq_along(x)) {
	print(x[i])
}

for(letter in x) {
	print(letter)
}

for(i in 1:4) print(x[i])


For loops can be nested

x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)

for(i in seq_len(nrow(x))) {
	for(j in seq_len(ncol(x))) {
		print(x[i, j])
	}
}


count <- 0
while(count < 10) {
	print(count)
	count <- count + 1
}


More than one condition

z <- 5

while(z >= 3 && z <= 10) {
	print(z)
	coin <- rbinom(1, 1, 0.5)

	if(coin == 1) { ## random walk
		z <- z + 1
	} else {
		z <- z - 1
	}
}


Functions

f <- function(<arguments>) {
	## Do something interesting
}


Argument Matching

R functions arguments can be matched positionally or by name. So the following calls to sd are all equivalent

> mydata <- rnorm(100)
> sd(mydata)
> sd(x = mydata)
> sd(x = mydata, na.rm = FALSE)
> sd(na.rm = FALSE, x = mydata)
> sd(na.rm = FALSE, mydata)


The “...” Argument

The ... argument indicate a variable number of arguments that are usually passed on to other functions.
... is often used when extending another function and you don’t want to copy the entire argument list of the original function.

myplot <- function(x, y, type = "l", ...) {
	plot(x, y, type = type, ...)
}


Lexical Scoping

make.power <- function(n) {
	pow <- function(x) {
		x^n
	}
	pow
}


> cube <- make.power(3)
> square <- make.power(2)
> cube(3)
[1] 27
> square(3)
[1] 9


Exploring a Function Closure

What’s in a function’s environment?

> ls(environment(cube))
[1] "n" "pow"
> get("n", environment(cube))
[1] 3
> ls(environment(square))
[1] "n" "pow"
> get("n", environment(square))
[1] 2


Dates and Times in R

R has developed a special representation of dates and times

• Dates are represented by the Date class
• Times are represented by the POSIXct or the POSIXlt class
• Dates are stored internally as the number of days since 1970-01-01
• Tmes are stored internally as the number of seconds since 1970-01-01


Dates in R

Dates are represented by the Date class and can be coerced from a character string using the as.Date() function.

x <- as.Date("1970-01-01")
x
## [1] "1970-01-01"
unclass(x)
## [1] 0
unclass(as.Date("1970-01-02"))
## [1] 1


Times in R

Times are represented using the POSIXct or the POSIXlt class
• POSIXct is just a very large integer under the hood; it use a useful class when you want to store times in something like a data frame
• POSIXlt is a list underneath and it stores a bunch of other useful information like the day of the week, day of the year, month, day of the month

There are a number of generic functions that work on dates and times
• weekdays: give the day of the week
• months: give the month name
• quarters: give the quarter number (“Q1”, “Q2”, “Q3”, or “Q4”)


Times in R

Times can be coerced from a character string using the as.POSIXlt or as.POSIXct function.

x <- Sys.time()
x
## [1] "2013-01-24 22:04:14 EST"
p <- as.POSIXlt(x)
names(unclass(p))
## [1] "sec" "min" "hour" "mday" "mon"
## [6] "year" "wday" "yday" "isdst"
p$sec
## [1] 14.34


Times in R

You can also use the POSIXct format.

x <- Sys.time()
x ## Already in ‘POSIXct’ format
## [1] "2013-01-24 22:04:14 EST"
unclass(x)
## [1] 1359083054
x$sec
## Error: $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors
p <- as.POSIXlt(x)
p$sec
## [1] 14.37


Times in R

Finally, there is the strptime function in case your dates are written in a different format

datestring <- c("January 10, 2012 10:40", "December 9, 2011 9:10")
x <- strptime(datestring, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M")
x
## [1] "2012-01-10 10:40:00 EST" "2011-12-09 09:10:00 EST"
class(x)
## [1] "POSIXlt" "POSIXt"


Operations on Dates and Times

You can use mathematical operations on dates and times. Well, really just + and -. You can do comparisons too (i.e. ==, <=)

x <- as.Date("2012-01-01")
y <- strptime("9 Jan 2011 11:34:21", "%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S")
x-y
## Warning: Incompatible methods ("-.Date",
## "-.POSIXt") for "-"
## Error: non-numeric argument to binary operator
x <- as.POSIXlt(x)
x-y
## Time difference of 356.3 days


Even keeps track of leap years, leap seconds, daylight savings, and time zones.

x <- as.Date("2012-03-01") y <- as.Date("2012-02-28")
x-y
## Time difference of 2 days
x <- as.POSIXct("2012-10-25 01:00:00")
y <- as.POSIXct("2012-10-25 06:00:00", tz = "GMT")
y-x
## Time difference of 1 hours
